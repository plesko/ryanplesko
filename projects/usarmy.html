      <h2>US Army: Show Your Strong Face</h2>
      <p class="title">The US Army&rsquo;s recruiting campaign had grown stale and was in danger of losing a vital demographic because of their lack of social media presence. They wanted a campaign that encouraged ongoing engagement and reached beyond just the attendees to their recruiting events. The solution? Associate the brand with characteristics their target demographic valued, then keep them involved through social media.</p>

      <p>The Army held a nationwide search for the face of their &ldquo;Army Strong&rdquo; campaign, and they needed to increase participation, interaction and awareness both online and off. I leveraged the social graph and advanced technology to increase interaction and connect recruits to the Army brand.</p>
      <p>At recruiting events around the nation, we utilized RFID and a custom, Facebook-connected application to capture and digitize the information we gathered. Recruits posed for photos that were automatically posted to Facebook, where they and their individual communities voted for the new face of the Army&rsquo;s recruiting efforts. Recruits &ldquo;showed their strong face&rdquo; at the event, establishing a personal connection to the Army&rsquo;s core message, and stayed engaged with the Facebook contest.</p>

      <p>Recruits wanted to be a part of Army Strong. Candidate engagement grew by an average of 25% at hundreds of events around the country. By encouraging friends and family members to vote for their candidate, we grew and strengthened a community of support for both the Army and recruits.</p>
