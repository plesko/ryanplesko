      <h2 class="small">Community Building with TEDxSMU</h2>
      <p class="title">Fresh, relevant content is the only way to keep online conversation alive and use it as a foundation for building a brand that continued that conversation into the offline world. TEDxSMU needed to feed a fire of engagement around its annual conference while developing a concurrent strategy to connect with and engage the Dallas community year-round. A dual objective required a dual strategy.</p>

      <p>We began with the conference itself, implementing an intense and hard-hitting social media strategy for the event. I managed a team dedicated to onsite live-tweeting in order to give fans who were not in attendance a play-by-play interactive experience while encouraging attendees to share their reactions and connect with one another.</p>
      <p>The Guerrilla Learning Project, a campaign I designed to evangelize the conference in communities where attendees lived and traveled, was so well received it earned a spot on stage. Posters with teaser message variations and QR codes were distributed to the audience, who in turn spread them among their communities. Through smartphone technology, the general public could scan codes or enter links that led to a mobile-optimized website hosting a specific TED Talk. The benefit was two-fold: It drove a higher online conversational footprint and served to spread the TED ethos and teach people in unexpected places.</p>
      <p>The event&rsquo;s community was thrilled with the heightened conversation online. The content strategy and templated design assets I created maintained a consistent brand message and resulted in making TEDxSMU one of the most active communities in the world.</p>
      <p>The Guerilla Learning Project yielded a wealth of data on message engagement, scanning locations, times and sharing, allowing us to use predictive modeling to anticipate where and when the TEDxSMU message would be most well-received. By monitoring message variation performance, we gleaned insights that enabled the TEDxSMU staff to better evangelize its doctrine.</p>
