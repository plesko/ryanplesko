      <h2>Cadillac: Live The Cadillac Life</h2>
      <p class="title">Cadillac had a firm grip on an older generation of car owners, but they needed to connect with a younger demographic in order to maintain future sales. They rebranded their national message, but still needed help engaging locally. An iPad giveaway wasn&rsquo;t the answer. They needed to show they could connect with a new generation of buyers.</p>

      <p>To draw in the desired 18 â€“ 34 demographic, I initiated a bold, attention-grabbing campaign designed to skyrocket social shares. The Live The Cadillac Life campaign was designed to create an instant, brand-supporting positive connection with the winners, putting them in a Cadillac for the weekend and pampering them with a fancy meal and luxury hotel room. The custom Facebook application built to support the initiative required engagement and spread well outside of their initial fan base. Pinterest, still relatively new to the social marketing scene at the time, was our playground and served as a test bed for experimenting with aesthetically based social content. We didn&rsquo;t just start a conversation among a younger audience. We caused a stir.</p>

      <p>Social media traffic and engagement shot up for the local dealer and traffic to retail centers increased as well. The hyper-local campaign received praise from both sides of the connection and added a fresh personality to the brand. Audiences spread the word across social media, with both immediate and residual effect. The ecard I created is still going strong on Pinterest today.</p>
