      <h2 class="small">Coke Zero: Fan Combine</h2>
      <p class="title">Coca-Cola wanted to connect to the fiercely loyal and boisterous fans of college football, an audience comprised of their target demographic. If they could increase fan engagement and visit length to their events taking place during games nationwide, they could separate themselves from their competitors and establish a better connection between soda drinkers and their brand.</p>
      <p>Through the  Coca-Cola Fan Combine, a mobile outdoor gaming event that pitted college football rivals against one another, we leveraged fansâ€™ dedication to their teams to create an emotional, competitive connection that led to increased engagement. The strategy required a sophisticated, yet fun, touch-enabled web application that ran on big screen monitors as well as detailed coordination with venue staff to help Coca-Cola brand ambassadors set up, run and manage the mobile events. We integrated live scorekeeping and social sharing to create a unique experience that got fans talking online and off.</p>
