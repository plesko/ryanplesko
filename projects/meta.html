      <h2 class="small">Meta: Making Smart the New Sexy</h2>
      <p class="title">Everyone knows the Fossil brand, but Meta, their smartwatch spin-off, struggled to establish a foothold in the burgeoning smartwatch market. They needed something that set them apart from the function-only alternatives stealing their web traffic. They needed to create a desire for their luxury product. Bottom line? They needed conversions.</p>

      <p>Meta&rsquo;s business model drives sales almost exclusively through the Internet, so we needed to do more than just revamp their image. I integrated advanced analytics into their marketing processes to create a brand driven by hard data with a feel that targeted their style-conscious, discerning clientele. The goal was to combine dry analysis of web traffic with a thorough understanding of nuanced online conversation. Starting with a website redesign and moving organically through a brand new social media strategy, we established a brand name with a consistent value proposition: wearable tech is the new sexy.</p>

      <p>Meta&rsquo;s organic search traffic increased and website conversions rose by more than 500%. I raised their Google ranking, optimized their online store for search engine optimization and streamlined the purchasing process for the consumer â€“ resulting in a better experience and bottom line.</p>
