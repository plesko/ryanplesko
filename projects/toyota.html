      <h2>Toyota Ride &amp; Drive</h2>
      <p class="title">Toyota knew there had to be a better way than dry surveys to gather the analytics they needed from attendees at their nationwide Ride and Drive events. They needed to establish positive consumer engagement and increase interaction in a way that would yield the data they were lacking. The challenge and opportunity lie in the possibility to leverage an existing customer base without turning them off with obvious marketing analysis tactics.</p>

      <p>I knew we needed to introduce interactive technology that made the data-gathering process engaging to the customer. I designed a slick touch screen application that reflected Toyota&rsquo;s sophisticated brand but was still easy to use and uber-friendly. Visitors to the Ride and Drive events wore RFID bracelets and used touch screen tablets to learn more about the options Toyota offered. By combining the information users entered during registration with analytics yielded by RFID technology, we encouraged users to participate and provided a way for them to connect with Toyota&rsquo;s brand while gathering a large silo of big data that could be used to drive more targeted marketing strategies.</p>

      <p>The campaign gave participants a pleasurable way to learn more about Toyota&rsquo;s products, solidifying the company&rsquo;s position as a market leader. Simultaneously, we enabled Toyota&rsquo;s marketing strategists to collect data that they used to identify market trends and craft messages that relied on actionable analytics to ensure accuracy and drive profitable marketing campaigns.</p>
