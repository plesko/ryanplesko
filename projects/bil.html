      <p class="title">TED seemed like everything I could have imagined. Except affordable. I helped create a community that encourages ideas and the sharing of them. Freely.</p>
      <p>We built everything from scratch. BIL started as a conversation between old and new friends and became an event that occurs multiple times a year across the world. The first BIL was held in February of 2008, not far from TED, in Monterrey, California. Since then, BIL has followed TED to Long Beach and now Vancouver, BC, because &ldquo;<a href="http://www.wired.com/2009/02/where-ted-goes/" target="_blank">where TED goes, BIL goes</a>&rdquo;.</p>
      <p>In 2014, for the first time, we had access to an array of projection screens that filled an entire wall of the venue&mdash;3,840 pixels worth. I wanted to take full advantage of the opportunity and, after a quick inspection of the physical equipment, began brainstorming the best way to put our new toy to use. With the use of the Sched API, the entire wall became a schedule, clock and information source that attendees could view from anywhere in the room with just a glance. Stage labels, sponsor logos and the current time indicator all remained fixed in place, while the current and upcoming talks were displayed in a ribbon that automatically scrolled along in real time. It was a beautiful thing.</p>
