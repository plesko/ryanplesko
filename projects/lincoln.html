      <p class="title">Lincoln had their strategy figured out and needed it executed quickly: Four touch-based tablet games designed to test participants recognition, memory, aptitude and intuition, all while supporting the brand&rsquo;s new image.</p>

      <p>With a ridiculously short deadline, the project required almost impossibly efficient management. By asking the right questions I was able to design and create the games that went into service with the precision Lincoln required. The games used Lincoln&rsquo;s new models&rsquo; features and competing vehicle comparisons to test participants at each event, who were then able to see their performance and ranking online as well as share their philanthropic involvement.</p>
