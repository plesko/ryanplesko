      <h2>Cumulus Media: Digital Realign</h2>
      <p class="title">Cumulus wanted to re-invent radio, but in order to understand and engage their emerging online fan base, they had to have a solid understanding of user experience and web-based trends. They needed expert insight to serve as the foundation for a shift in their digital marketing efforts and a system to help them manage audience engagement across all of their radio stations.</p>

      <p>I started from the ground up, beginning with a digital audit that revealed emerging trends such as DJ-driven streaming services that their fans were clamoring for. Analytics confirmed that radio is largely driven by local audiences, so we created a socially driven CMS platform that allowed stations and shows to curate content distributed to their Facebook pages with a consistent voice. Individual stations, shows and listeners could now easily engageâ€”allowing Cumulus to expose them to broader messages.</p>
      <p>When all was said and done, Cumulus had undergone a complete digital and social overhaul. The project included a redesign of hundreds of individual station websites that included new digital interfaces designed to optimize consumption of entertainment, sports and news. Combined with a targeted social media strategy that included Facebook application development, Cumulus realized better listener engagement and built a sustainable online community.</p>
