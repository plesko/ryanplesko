      <h2 class="small">Fatboy USA: Social Engagement</h2>
      <p class="title">Fatboy had a solid understanding of their retail base, but lacked insight to their online footprint. They knew they needed a better understanding of their customer, who was sharing their products and who was driving their sales in order to optimize their digital communication.</p>
      <p>I created a Facebook application that communicated the brand's personality and, by leveraging the social graph, provided key data points about new and existing customers. Fatboy’s leadership was eager to learn, so I provided in-depth reporting on the power of highly engaging, psychologically based messaging and how it correlates back to sales. Fatboy’s internal marketing team learned how to manage analytics and develop online strategies based on user behavior.</p>

      <p>The “This or That” campaign asked a simple question that produced a lot of insight. Fans of the brand were presented with two Fatboy products and asked to choose their favorite in the Facebook campaign. The simplicity of the interaction left little barrier to participation and the data available through the users’ connected profiles generated more scientifically precise personas. The “Spotted” campaign, a separate Tumblr presence, encouraged the submission of photos of fans lounging on a Fatboy, promoting social shares and increasing awareness. Using the data collected, I designed, placed and managed more targeted and effective social ad campaigns, increasing online engagement.</p>
      <p>We received submissions of photos and stories from stores, homes and events across the country. Fatboy established new social media monitoring practices in order to keep tabs on their online user analytics on an ongoing basis, helping them maintain the digital brand strategy I created.</p>

      <h2>Ham it up, Fatboy</h2>
      <p>As an added touch, I launched the "Spotted" campaign encouraging the submission of photos of their fans lounging on a fatboy. The separate blog added another layer of engagement and a healthy helping of fun. Shots were submitted from across the country from stores, homes, and events.
