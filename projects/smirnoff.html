      <h2>Smirnoff Battle of the Clubs</h2>
      <p class="title">Smirnoff was looking for a global strategy to connect and engage fans in a way that was interactive, entertaining, and data-driven. They needed a concept that reflected the cool factor that drove their brand. Nightclubs are full of existing and potential customers, and Smirnoff was able to connect to that audience in a way they never knew was possible.</p>

      <p>People love a good competition, so I developed the Battle of the Clubs, a competition where fans cast votes for their favorite clubs and signature Smirnoff drinks both online and on-site. The winning clubs and participating fans were rewarded with massive parties all over the world. Using RFID wristbands and tablet applications, club-goers engaged right where the action was, sharing photos and excitement online that cemented the Smirnoff message in a way that drove sales and increased brand loyalty.</p>
      <p>At the final party of the campaign, where Madonna performed in New York City, I presented attendees with a thirty-foot tall, dynamic, continuously-moving, real-time infographic. Using data gathered from Battle of the Clubs participantsâ€™ Facebook profiles and real life interactions at the each of parties held globally, I was able to design and develop an application that illustrated how Smirnoff fans across the world were connected to each other and to the global community.</p>

      <p>Smirnoff engaged its fan base and promoted its name through the club events, driving sales on location and creating experiences that gave it an even firmer footing in the market. By involving both online and offline communities, we increased the Smirnoff fan base and social engagement, reaching millions of users throughout the campaign.</p>
